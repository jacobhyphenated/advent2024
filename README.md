# Advent of Code 2024

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) is a set of small yearly programming problems for a variety of skill levels. They can be solved in any programming language; this year I chose Rust to expiriment more with the language. Rust is not my primary language, so I'm using this as a learning exercise.

### Running the Code
If Rust is installed on the machine, you can run the code with `cargo run <day>` using the `day` variable to specify what days should be run. You may specify multiple days.

Examples:
```sh
cargo run 1
cargo run 4 5 6
```
